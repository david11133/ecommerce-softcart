# MongoDB NoSQL Catalog Database

All of SoftCart's catalog data will be stored on a MongoDB NoSQL server. Create the database catalog and import our electronics products from catalog.json into a collection named electronics. Run test queries against the data and export the collection into a file named electronics.csv using only the _id, type, and model fields.
